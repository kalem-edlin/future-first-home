# future-first-home
A Summer of Tech Create Camp project that was made by my team of developers and designers. Future First Home is a web-app that works to solve the problem of stigma around purchasing first homes as a young adult by helping them to visualise their saving projections showing future first homes from a TradeMe API that align with their saving projections.
